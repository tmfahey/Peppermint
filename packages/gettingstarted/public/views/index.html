			<p>Welcome to Peppermint, the easiest way to collect payments from your group! </p>

			<h2 id="what-is-peppermint">What is Peppermint?</h2>

			<p>Whether you are collecting money from group members for new t-shirts, annual dues, or a trip, Peppermint will help you <strong>send</strong> payment requests, <strong>track</strong> who has or hasn't paid, and <strong>deposit</strong> the money in your bank account - <strong>no more paper checks or cash</strong>! Peppermint is mobile and desktop friendly, and can be set up for depositing to either a personal or a group account.</p>

			<p>At this moment, Peppermint requests payments on your behalf using Venmo, a completely secure and free application for sending and receiving money instantly. Venmo is used by millions of Americans, and if you don't have a Venmo account, you can easily create one using a phone number and email address.</p>

			<h2 id="group-collection">If you're collecting payments on behalf of an organization with a bank account</h2>

			<p>In order to set up a Venmo account to collect payments for your organization, you'll need a cell phone number. Although most groups don't have a dedicated cell phone number, you can easily obtain a *free* phone number using <a href="http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html">Google Voice.</a> This phone number will be connected to an email address and / or your cell phone number, where you will be able to receive texts to keep track of your Venmo activity. With this new number, you can sign up for a Venmo account as shown. </p>

			<h2 id="connect-account">Connect your Venmo account</h2>

			<p>Once you have logged into your Venmo account and clicked "Accept", you will be able to request payments from any one who you add as a Member. These payments will be sent to your Venmo account, where you can "Cash Out" overnight to <a href="#cash-out">transfer funds directly to your bank account.</a></p>

			<h2 id="add-members">Adding members</h2>

			<p>Navigate to the "Members" tab on the top left, and add any members that you would like to collect payments from in the future. You can edit their name, phone, or email address at any time.</p>

			<p>We strongly <strong>recommend using phone numbers</strong> instead of emails whenever possible, because phone numbers are unique (while most people have several emails). If you do use email, you'll want to use the email address that your group member signed up for Venmo with. This helps ensure that Peppermint can properly connect your members with their Venmo accounts.</p>

			<p>If a group member does not have a Venmo account, they will still receive the payment request. From there, they can set up an account to complete your payment, or can continue . </p>

			<h2 id="send-payment-requests">Sending Payment Requests</h2>

			<p>Sending payment requests to anyone in your group is easy! First navigate to the "Request Payments" tab on the top left of the screen. Then click the "None selected" button under "Request a payment from" and select as many group members as you'd like by clicking on the names. When you're done, enter a number, like 1.00 for $1.00, and a note to describe the payment you are requesting, i.e. "Monthly dues" or "Team Tshirts".</p> 

			<img src="/gettingstarted/assets/img/demonstrating-payment.png">

			<p>Click "Request Payment", and you will see the status of your payment requests pop up on the right.</p> 

			<img src="/gettingstarted/assets/img/successful-payment-request.png">

			<p>You can view the details of any payment request by clicking on the row in the table, and can manage payment requests in the Dashboard.</p>

			<img src="/gettingstarted/assets/img/click-for-details.png">

			<h2 id="group-members">How does it work for my group members?</h2>

			<p>When you send a payment request to a group member, they will get an email from Venmo or a push notification on their phone stating that you / your group has requested payment (with the amount you requested) with the note you attached to the payment. All they have to do is click "Pay" to complete the charge using Venmo. 
			</p>

			<h2 id="mark-as-paid">What if someone pays me without using Venmo?</h2>

			<p>If someone pays you in a manner other than completing your Venmo charge, you can change the status of their payment request to completed by clicking "Mark as Paid". This will also cancel the Venmo request for this payment.
			</p>

			<h2 id="cash-out">How do I get the money from my Venmo account into my bank account?</h2>

			<p>Send the money from your Venmo balance to your bank account overnight and for free by "cashing out". Login to your Venmo account, and click the "Cash Out to Your Bank" link to transfer the balance to your account.</p>

			<img src="/gettingstarted/assets/img/cash-out.png">

			<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

			<p><strong>Every payment processed through Peppermint defaults to "Private"</strong>, so you won't be broadcasting your group's financial activity to the Venmo newsfeed. You can rest assured that <strong>Peppermint will never create or request payments that you have not authorized</strong>, and none of your data is shared. </p>
